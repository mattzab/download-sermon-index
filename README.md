A Bash Script To Download All Sermons On SermonIndex.net

# Linux Users:
Download Bash Script, Download Zip file with all Speakers XML Files, and execute the bash script from within the directory containing the XML files.

# Mac Users:
I wrote this script on Linux, but I suspect it should work exactly the same for you. Untested.

# Windows Users:
Use Cygwin and install wget, then navigate through the terminal to the directory with the XML files, and run the script from there.
